                        As part of the Igniting dreams seminar, we award cash prizes to very young entrepreneurs after having taken them through a rigorous process of training. We usually open for applications to the prize. When we receive the proposals, our team of independent
                        panel sit and consider them. They shortlist five (5) finalists who are then prepared and trained by our tea, of professionals to pitch their businesses on the Igniting Dreams seminar platform. So far, the prize has supported 5
                        young entrepreneurs â€“most of whom have gone ahead to take major steps towards growing their business.


                    </p>
                    <p>Take for example, Hamza Mabruka (Winner of 2019 Igniting Dreams Prize): After winning the 2019 Igniting Dreams Prize, Mabruka went ahead to register her business with the country authorities and also satisfied all the certifications
                        that were required of her as an entrepreneur in the food production industry. She proceeded to apply to other available grants, pitched and won them. Today, Mabruka owns her own business farm, a peanut production company as well
                        as a foundation geared towards mentoring and empowering basic school students in the Wa Municipality. As the organization that provided the first platform for Mabruka to pitch her idea and connect her to a mentor, we are proud
                        of the feats that she has achieved, thanks to her hard work and of course, our support.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the prize is currently woefully insufficient to support even a quarter of the number of applicants, we are calling on donors and philanthropists alike to support us to produce more Hamza Mabrukas.
